## My process
After researching potential approaches for the table due to this being the first time working on one and using css.

After formating all the text and placing the image. I started to work on the design from the point of a mobile screen size before scaling to desktop which made it easier to work on the css developement. Since everything is being workeed on backwords.

Once I produced the code, the last thing I wanted to focus on was the image formating.

Though the issue I ran into was formating the image for the mobile screen size to look like the images provided. I ended up settling for a smaller scale version of the image. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<table>
      <tr>
        <td>Calories</td>
        <th>277kcal</th>
      </tr>
```
```css
ol li::marker {
    color: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    font-family: 'outfit', sans-serif;
    padding-inline-start: 20px;
    font-weight: bold;
    
}

table {
    width: 100%;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    margin-block: 20px;
}

tr {
    border-bottom: .5px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.214);
    line-height: 20px;
}

td {
    padding-block: 10px;
    padding-inline: 30px;
}

th {
    text-align: left;
    padding-block: 10px;
    padding-inline: 40px;
    color: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    font-weight: bold;
}
```



### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on how to reformat images to look different on various screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Styling Table](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp)
 - This helped me with styling the table in css. I really liked this source and am going to use in future css to help style tables according to my ui design iterations.
